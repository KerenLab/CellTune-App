## CellTuneDepot
&nbsp;  
**CellTuneDepot** is a curated collection of multiplexed imaging datasets with expert-validated labels, intended for benchmarking, model training, and reproducible analysis.

- [Download (v0.1)](https://github.com/yuvalbussi/CellTune-App/releases/latest/download/CellTuneDepot.zip)

CellTuneDepot is organized into two main sections: 
1. *Manual Labels* = fully manually labeled crops/images
2. *High-Quality Labels* = semi-supervised labels for entire datasets generated with CellTune

Each section is then further subdivided by dataset.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Each dataset includes:  
- Multiplexed images
- Segmentation masks
- Channel and cell type metadata
- Population labels
- Cell table containing per-cell mean protein expression

*Datasets associated with unpublished studies will be released upon their publication.*

> See the *Methods* section of our [manuscript](citation) for more details on all datasets.
