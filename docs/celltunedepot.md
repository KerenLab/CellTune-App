## CellTuneDepot
&nbsp;  
**CellTuneDepot** is a curated collection of multiplexed imaging datasets with expert-validated labels, intended for benchmarking, model training, and reproducible analysis.

- [Download (v0.3.0)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/odjjy69lcmn86pmrbjllk/CellTuneDepot.zip?rlkey=t99osnf5hx9wu3oen607rzmgf&e=1&dl=1) 

CellTuneDepot is organized into two main sections: 
1. *Manual Labels*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#888888">Fully manually labeled crops/images</span>
2. *High-Quality Labels*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#888888">Semi-supervised labels generated with CellTune for entire datasets</span>

Each section is then further subdivided by dataset.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Each dataset includes:  
- Multiplexed images
- Segmentation masks
- Channel and cell type metadata
- Population labels
- Cell table containing per-cell mean protein expression

*Datasets associated with unpublished studies will be released upon publication of their respective manuscripts.*

> See the *Methods* section of our [manuscript](citation) for more details on all datasets.
