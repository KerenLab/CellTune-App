## Export Data  

CellTune can export classifications in multiple formats, including population tables (.csv, .parquet) and *AnnData* objects. You can also export a CellTable containing selected features and predicted labels. Image export is still in an early phase, and we’re adding new capabilities regularly. Expect more export formats and customization options soon.
