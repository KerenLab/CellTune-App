## Projects
&nbsp; 

A **CellTune Project** is the central workspace where all images, tables, populations, classifiers, and project settings are stored. Each project has a predictable folder structure, making it easy to organize large studies and keep data, intermediate files, and results in one place.

### Recommended Folder Layout

You can just [download the Demo Data](/tutorials/getting-started/demo-data) which contains the recommended layout for you to use!

We recommend creating a top-level directory called:

    CellTune_Store/

Inside it, create two subfolders:

    CellTune_Store/
        CellTune_Data/
        CellTune_Projects/


`CellTune_Data` is where you place the raw inputs that CellTune will use (see [Data Preparation](/documentation/getting-started/data-preparation) section).

It contains two folders :

`Images/`      ← Preprocessed or raw images you want to load into CellTune  
`Tables/`      ← Marker, CellType, and any other cell, patient, sample, or other metadata tables for your project.


`CellTune_Projects` is where all CellTune projects should be created and managed.
Individual project folders will be generated through the GUI when you [setup and start a new project](/documentation/getting-started/project-setup).


&nbsp; 

**Project Naming:**

When creating a new project, we recommend using a consistent name format:

{TISSUE/DISEASE}_{MmmDDYY}

For example:

- Melanoma_Jan1426 
- Colon_Nov0825 


Your project should be created (through the GUI) at:

*CellTune_Store/CellTune_Projects/{PROJ_NAME}/*


### Project Structure

When CellTune creates a project, it generates the following folders and files:

    {PROJ_NAME}/
        Images/
        Tables/
        Populations/
        Classifiers/
        {PROJ_NAME}.ctp
	
![Example_Project_Folder](/assets/documentation/Example_Project_Folder.png){: width="30%"}   


**{PROJ_NAME}.ctp**

A single project database file (CellTuneProject) that stores all project settings, app state, and internal variables.

**Images Folder**

Inside `Images/`, CellTune maintains several subfolders used during processing:

    Images/
        Input/
        Preprocessing/
        Zarr/
        Exports/

- `Input`: Contains soft/hard links to your images from CellTune_Data/{PROJ_NAME}/Images.
- `Preprocessing`: Temporary intermediates generated during preprocessing (*Still under development*).
- `Zarr`: Optimized OME-Zarr stores generated by CellTune from your input; this is what the viewer uses.
- `Exports` — Any images you export out of CellTune (e.g., RGB composites, overlays).
&nbsp;

**Tables Folder**

    /Tables/
        … cell tables (features) for each image …

This folder holds the cell feature tables generated or used by CellTune.

**Populations Folder**

All population-related data is stored here:

    Populations/
        Predictions/
        Classifications/
        Labels/
        Cell_Samples/
        Info/
        Gating/
        Other/


- `Predictions`: Model prediction outputs
- `Classifications`: Final assigned cell types
- `Labels`: User-provided labels
- `Cell_Samples`: Sampled cells saved during gating or active learning
- `Gating`: Gating results
- `Info`: Metadata describing population sets
- `Other`: Miscellaneous population data


**Classifiers Folder**

Stores trained classification models (*This is still under development*)


### Save Project

At any time you can save a project from the Menu or keyboard shortcut `Cmd + S`. 

Before you close the project it will ask if you want to save the project (you should!).

![Save_Project_Close](/assets/documentation/Save_Project_Close.png){: width="55%"}   

> Note: CellTune autosaves most parameters / settings as they change. Larger objects like populations are saved when changing populations.
