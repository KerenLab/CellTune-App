## Data Exploration

Data exploration helps you understand channel expression and the underlying expression patterns of cells in your data. With CellTune’s visualization and unsupervised clustering tools, you can quickly identify candidate celltypes or lineages to focus your gating, landmarking, and labeling on. This section covers how to inspect your data before moving into the classification workflow.


### Subpopulation Clustering
You can select a subset of populations and cluster them alone. 
For example, you can gate on CD8 and create a population of CD8+ cells, then cluster those cells only. 
This can be helpful to see subsets of populations that are not seen when clustering all of the cells together.
