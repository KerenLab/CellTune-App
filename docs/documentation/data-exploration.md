## Data Exploration

Data exploration helps you understand channel expression and the underlying expression patterns of cells in your data. With CellTune’s visualization and unsupervised clustering tools, you can quickly identify candidate celltypes or lineages to focus your gating, landmarking, and labeling on. This section covers how to inspect your data before moving into the classification workflow.
