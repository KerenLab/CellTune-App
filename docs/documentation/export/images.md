## Export Images

Image export is under active development. 
You can currently export the image visible to a `.png`. 

![Menu_Export_Image](/assets/documentation/Menu_Export_Image.png){: width="35%"}  

There is a folder /Images/Exports conveniently created for you to organize your exported images. 

![Export_Image_Files](/assets/documentation/Export_Image_Files.png)
