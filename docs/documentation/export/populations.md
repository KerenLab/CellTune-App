## Export Populations 

Population sets can be exported through Export → Population Set.
CellTune will save both:
- the population set file ('.csv' or '.parquet'), and
- a corresponding .info file containing the population set metadata (equivalent to a CellTypeTable).

Both files are written to the same folder using the name you selected.

These exported population sets and info can be easily used in downstream analyses, edited, and/or shared with collaborators.
