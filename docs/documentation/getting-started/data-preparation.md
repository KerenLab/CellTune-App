## Data Preparation

***This documentation is currently undergoing updates right now... please see the [Tutorials](tutorials)***

*Before starting with CellTune, you’ll just need to organize your* ***multiplexed images*** *and* ***segmentations***. 

We highly recommend [pre-processing your images](/documentation/getting-started/data-preparation/images#pre-processing) to clean out background, noise, and artifacts. 

*You can also **optionally** prepare a table of initial cell type information which can be used for automated landmarking and automated channel selection during cell review.*

### Compatibility

CellTune supports pyramidal image formats (e.g. ) non-pyramidal image formats, including single TIFF, 
Support for very large pyramidal formats (e.g., OME-TIFF, QPTIFF, OME-ZARR) and speed improvements have recently been added.
