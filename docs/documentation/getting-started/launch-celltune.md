## Launch CellTune
> Note, CellTune currently doesn't support dark-mode, please adjust your computer settings to light-mode before launching. Dark-mode will be available very shortly. 

- After installation and starting the CellTune app, it should open to a startup screen with buttons to either start a new project or to load an existing one (as seen in the [new project setup tutorial](/tutorials/getting-started/new-project-setup)). 
- You can start a new project following the [Documentation - Project Setup](/documentation/project-setup). 
- It is highly recommended to download the demo data and follow the [Tutorials](/tutorials) in parallel.
