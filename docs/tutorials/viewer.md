### Segment Controls & Select Cell
&nbsp;  

This video demonstrates how to adjust hover fill settings (the red highlight can switch from showing cell borders to filling the entire cell when hovering). 

Cells can be selected or unselected in the viewer by pressing `Shift` + `Left Click`. Selected cells are indicated by crosshairs. 

You can also select a cell by entering its ID in the segment controls, which will automatically zoom to that cell. The cell ID of the currently **hovered** cell (not selected cell) is displayed in the legend.

*Note: Cell hover info shown in legend turned on with keyboard shortcut `Cmd` + `I`*
