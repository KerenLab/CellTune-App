## Labeling & Review 

Labeling and Review are central to building high-quality training data in CellTune. After generating candidate populations through gating or model predictions, Review allows you to inspect cells one by one, correct mistakes, and assign confident labels. Interacting directly with the data also makes it easy to spot unexpected patterns and discover new cell types. In this section, you’ll learn how to label cells and use Review to refine, validate, and expand your labels.
