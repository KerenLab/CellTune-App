## Gating

Gating is a powerful way to explore and separate cell populations, but spillover and overlapping markers make it difficult to classify all cells accurately using gates alone. CellTune enhances this process with tools for cell sampling, review, landmark gating, and complex gate construction, allowing you to iteratively refine populations and build high-quality cell type definitions.

This tutorial walks you through both basic and advanced gating techniques, showing how to use gating effectively as part of the broader CellTune workflow.
