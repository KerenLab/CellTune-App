## Compatibility

CellTune currently supports non-pyramidal single-TIFF images, organized as demonstrated in the [Tutorial](tutorials).
The recommended image size is 1024 × 1024 pixels. Larger images (tested up to 5000 × 5000 pixels) are also supported, though performance may decrease.
Support for very large pyramidal formats (e.g., OME-TIFF, OME-ZARR) and speed improvements will be added in the coming weeks.
