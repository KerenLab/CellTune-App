# Welcome to CellTune
&nbsp;  
**CellTune is an integrative software to expedite accurate cell classification in spatial proteomics**. 

Designed for researchers analyzing large cohorts of spatial proteomics data, CellTune streamlines cell classification through a comprehensive and highly optimized human-in-the-loop active learning workflow. By strategically selecting cells with high uncertainty, the platform maximizes the impact of user input and enables the discovery of fine-grained and novel cell types. CellTune advances core capabilities across visualization, gating, annotation, and spatial feature extraction — all within a unified, intuitive, and code-free interface — to efficiently achieve state-of-the-art classification accuracy and resolution at scale.

To benchmark CellTune, we created [***CellTuneDepot***](#celltunedepot)—the largest fully manually labeled multiplexed imaging dataset to date—comprising over 40,000 cells comprehensively annotated by experts across 30 cell types. In addition, CellTuneDepot contains over 3 million high-quality semi-supervised labels generated with CellTune across a variety of tissues and disease states with accuracy comparable to expert annotation.

Together, CellTune and CellTuneDepot provide a powerful toolkit for classifying cells and accelerating biological discovery in spatial proteomics.
