# Welcome to CellTune

**CellTune** is an interactive software platform for accurate, high-resolution, and efficient cell classification in multiplexed tissue imaging data.

Combining visualization, manual annotation, and human-in-the-loop active learning, CellTune streamlines the labeling process and enhances classification performance. By engaging users with uncertain or ambiguous predictions, the platform maximizes information extracted from expert input and enables the discovery of novel cell types. 



To benchmark CellTune, we created **CellTuneDepot**—the largest fully manually labeled multiplexed imaging dataset to date—comprising over 40,000 cells comprehensively annotated by experts across 30 cell types. 

In addition, CellTuneDepot contains over 3 million high-quality semi-supervised labels generated with CellTune across a variety of tissues and disease states with accuracy comparable to expert annotation.

Together, CellTune and CellTuneDepot provide a powerful toolkit for classifying cells and accelerating biological discovery in spatial proteomics.

## Download CellTuneDepot

**CellTuneDepot** is a curated collection of multiplexed imaging datasets with expert-validated labels, intended for benchmarking, model training, and reproducible analysis.

- [Download CellTuneDepot (v1.0)](https://github.com/yuvalbussi/CellTune-App/releases/latest/download/CellTuneDepot.zip)

CellTuneDepot is organized into two main sections: **manual labels** and **CellTune-generated high-quality labels**, and further subdivided by dataset. Each dataset includes:
- Multiplexed images
- Segmentation masks
- Channel and cell type metadata
- Population labels
- A cell table containing per-cell mean protein expression

Datasets associated with unpublished studies will be released upon their publication.

> 📁 See the "Methods" section of our manuscript for more details on all datasets.
